      ".  In the production and operation process, the Company has relatively limited negative impact on the environment, and there  isn’t material amount of hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste discharge, and the fuel pollution is slight. Therefore, no  corresponding statistics have been formed in this regard, but the Company clearly stipulates that the waste generated in the  production and operation link shall not be discarded at random and must be handed over to dedicated organizations for disposal.  At the same time, the Company strives to reduce the possible negative impact of packaging and transportation on the environment  by purchasing environment-friendly raw materials, increasing R&D investment on energy saving, upgrading outdated equipment,  and promoting energy-saving transportation vehicles.

      "\n",
      "我公司编制本报告遵循了全球报告倡议组织(GRI)标准的核心选项,重点披露与利益相关方密切相关的\"水资源和污水\"议题信息。我们坚持规范运作、客观公正的原则,报告内容经过公司治理体系的审议和批准,信息的真实性、准确性、完整性由公司最高决策机构监督和负责。\n",

      "二、\"水资源和污水\"议题管理政策 \n",
      "\n",
      "公司将\"水资源和污水\"问题视为关乎可持续发展的核心环境议题。我们遵循\"节约优先、防治污染、循环利用、因地制宜\"的治理方针,遵从国家法律法规,结合行业实践,制定了《环境管理制度》和《水资源管理制度》,为议题管控提供了规范指引。   \n",
      "\n",
      "公司将污水处理设施建设和运营纳入年度资本开支预算,持续加大投资力度。对于新场区选址,我们优先选择临近市政污水管网区域,并按国家排放标准建设自有污水处理设施。在日常运营中,我们加强闭路循环、中水回用,大幅降低废水排放量;聘请第三方环境检测公司对排放水质进行监测,确保达标排放;积极探索膜生物反应器等先进处理工艺的应用。\n",
      "\n",
      "三、议题管理举措\n",
      "\n",
      "(一)环境管理体系 \n",
      "\n",
      "我公司成立了以总经理为组长的\"绿色发展委员会\",统筹公司环境、气候变化等议题的顶层设计和组织实施。委员会每年至少开展一次环境风险评估,对气候相关风险的识别、评估、控制和应对提出明确要求;并安排不少于3次现场巡查,加强对废水排放等环节的监督管理。\n",
      "\n",
      "我们还设立ESG工作小组,由外聘顾问带领公司环保、工程、运营、财务等相关职能部门组建,制定环保目标并监督达成情况。ESG工作小组每季度汇总现场管理和排放监测等报告,上报绿色发展委员会。\n",
      "\n",
      "(二)具体管理行动   \n",
      "\n",
      "1. 污水处理设施        \n",
      "\n",
      "目前我们在全国166个营运场区100%建有污水处理设施,包括常规化学处理设施和膜生物反应器等先进设备。2022年,我们新建30座膜生物反应器污水处理设施,总投资2500万元;未来三年,我们将持续采用该技术,确保污水处理效果稳定达标。         \n",
      "\n",
      "2. 中水回用\n",
      "\n",
      "我们高度重视废水循环利用。所有场区均100%配备初级中水回用设施,用于场区绿化、清洗等环节。截止2022年底,公司累计建有8座二级中水回用设施,本年度新增2座,实现废水深度处理后全部回用。除传统的景观绿化、道路清洁等领域,我们正在推广中水在办公生活中的使用,用于冲厕、车辆清洗等。\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 智能控制        \n",
      "\n",
      "为有效监控和减少废水排放,我司所有场区引入工控系统,对排水水质、水量实现自动检测。污水中的COD、氨氮等指标超标将立即触发报警,从源头上控制污染物的排放。我们还建立了视频内部巡查系统和第三方实地抽检机制,确保废水处理达标达量。\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 内部培训\n",
      "\n",
      "我们非常重视员工的职业培训。2022年度,我司共举办80场次废水处理和循环利用相关的培训课程,培训人次达2.1万,内容涵盖国家法规政策解读、污水处理技术、智能管控系统运维等。培训采取理论讲授、现场实操和在线学习相结合,提升从业人员的技能和环保意识。\n",
      "\n",
      "四、具体案例\n",
      "\n",
      "(案例一)膜生物反应器提升废水处理效率\n",
      "\n",
      "近年来,我司在福建省某物流园区新建了膜生物反应器污水处理系统。该系统首先采用生物处理工艺除去可溶性有机污染物,再通过超滤膜隔离絮凝污泥,最后由反渗透膜进行深度脱盐。它可实现污水全循环利用,且对COD、氨氮等污染物的去除率高达99%以上。园区2022年全年中水回用率达78%,同比提升15个百分点。         \n",
      "\n",
      "(案例二)开发废水监测APP,实现移动智能管控\n",
      "\n",
      "我司与高校合作,自主研发了\"环保智控\"APP。该系统实时采集污水排放口的水质、水量数据,并通过算法模型判断是否超标,对异常情况发送预警。现场人员可利用App查看统计报表,了解整体排放状况。我们还在App中内置国家及地方排放标准,为排放达标提供依据。目前该App已在公司50个重点场区上线,未来将全面推广使用。\n",
      "\n",
      "(案例三)开设新员工必修课程\"绿色操作规范\" \n",
      "\n",
      "为强化从业人员的环保意识,提高治污减排能力,我司2022年新设置了培训课程\"绿色操作规范\"。该门必修课为期一周,混合教学模式,主要内容包括废水处理常见难题分析、化学安全规范、污水处理设备使用演示等。该课程入职率100%,员工对相关知识的掌握和日常规范操作的执行得到了明显改善。\n",
      "\n",
      "五、展望未来\n",
      "\n",
      "展望未来,我司将进一步强化水资源管理,制定行动计划深入推广先进处理设备;加大污水减排力度,到2025年底,实现全国营运场区废水零直接排放;完善监测体系,投入启用统一化的全网监控平台。我们将立足新发展理念,坚定不移地探索循环经济新模式,推动企业向绿色低碳转型,实现资源的充分利用,为建设美丽中国贡献力量。\n",
      "\n",
      "以上是公司\"水资源和污水\"重要性议题的管理政策及实践。本报告严格遵循GRI标准框架的要求,内容客观真实、结构合理、数据一致,对公司在该议题上所做的努力和取得的成绩予以全面披露。我们虚心听取社会各界的意见和建议,共同推进公司的可持续发展事业。\n"
